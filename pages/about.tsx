              and a recent UCLA graduate (Class of 2025!) with a degree in Mathematics of Computation.
              I did not start coding until my second year of college, and I definitely struggled at first.
              But over time, something clicked, and I came to enjoy the creativity and problem-solving behind it.

              <span className="font-semibold text-[#E00D50]"> Since then, I&apos;ve explored various areas of tech. </span> I interned twice at a data protection company, where I learned a lot about cybersecurity.
              To gain broader experience, I started freelancing and currently work with All Around Children to turn raw data into meaningful business insights.
              I am also pursuing an AI/ML certification through UT Austin to strengthen my technical foundation.

              but I am especially drawn to EdTech, ClimateTech, and Finance.
              I am passionate about using AI to make education more accessibleâ€”particularly for students who lack access to resources.
              I also care deeply about sustainability and am curious about how technology can help people manage their money more intentionally.

              I hope to pursue a masters in machine learning and get involved in research.
              At the core of everything I do is the belief that technology should make the world easier, fairer, and better for everyone.
